He immediately took action against the town&apos;s mafia, bringing one of their heads to court. The next day, his lawyer was found dead in his office, and no further action was taken. The target, Benardo Camerini, is the head of the town&apos;s mafia, which will likely collapse without him. Although he lacks personal security, mafia will be guarding the town&apos;s streets.",
