        "Description": "Good evening, agent.\r\rYour target is Oscar Himura, former ICA agent and current fixer working under a list of Providence clients.\r\rA &quot;poison artist&quot; and indiscriminate killer, Himura was the ICA's youngest field agent when issued his status in 1991.  Since then, he worked for the ICA in its prime during the late 1990s and the 2000s. He also served as a mentor to many current members, such as his protege, Agent Davenport, who took up the mantle of the ICA's top poisoner after Himura's departure from the agency in 2011. Not long after that, he took up a post as a Providence operative and has been one of their most effective agents to date, eventually vanishing from our radar six years ago.\r\rRecently, it seems he's gotten rather sloppy since. One of Himura's long-used aliases popped onto the Gama Private Hospital ledger less than a few days before the accidental death of a decorated Anti-Boryokudan captain via unprepared fugu, which happens to be Himura's modus operandi. However - before his death, the captain was investigating Gama's head mortician, Katashi Ito. As it stands, director Akira Nakamura's ties to the Yakuza were confirmed by local police after Nakamura was sighted on multiple occasions to be in close contact with former Yakuza lawyer, Yuki Yamazaki. As Ito was present for a string of personal pay-offs by Nakamura, it's not unlikely he may be a cleaner for Nakamura, and by extension, the Yakuza.\r\rYour job is to hunt down and eliminate Himura, and uncover Ito's secret - I hear there may be a keycard in Nakamura's office that could be the key to discovering it. I'll leave the rest to you. Happy hunting.\r\rThis contract was made by Script for the HITMAN Community Roadmap. Join our discord at https://hitman.community/discord for more information!",
