Everyone thought it was a simple case of political murder, but nothing could be further from the truth. A private detective discovered that Hilde was behind her husband&apos;s murder. She did this to start her own political career by gaining sympathy for her husband&apos;s death. Fortunately, this information was leaked to the public and she escaped to this very island to change her identity.",
