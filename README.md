An open database of Hitman contracts, so they are not lost to time. Commits are automatic, no PRs please!

## Featured Contracts
Featured contracts are located in the `featured` folder. These are separated by game version.

Almost all HITMAN 2 featured contracts are in HITMAN 3. So only the HITMAN 3 versions are stored within the HITMAN 2 folder, the entitlements will be translated by Peacock.

## Releases
Releases currently only contain featured contracts. There are currently no plans to package the contracts folder for release.
