He used to be the Captain on the RMS Vilovia, but he and his Crew purposefully rammed the Ship on a Boulder so that everybody would evacuate and the Crew could loot the stuff they left behind. However, everybody got caught and sent to Prison, except for Captain Rutherford. Our Client was on that ship and lost two of his Children, so he wanted the same thing to happen to Captain Rutherford.\r\rHappy Hunting 47.",
