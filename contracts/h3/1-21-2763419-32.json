Your target is Constantin, butler and dear friend of The Constant.\r\rMany years ago, our client&apos;s partner had a meeting with The Constant and was never seen again. Our client knew very well what happened with his partner, but couldn&apos;t take any legal action against someone as powerful as The Constant. After years of personal investigation, he discovered that the butler helped in the partner&apos;s disappearance.\r\rMake sure The Constant endures what our client had to many years ago.",
